Still to do/nice to have:
---------------
- Add mouse-over text to each circle to display the name(s) of the awardee(s).
- Add the ability to drag the awards and reorder them vertically.
- Add citation data (when available)
- Deal better with the case of multiple recipients of an award in the same year. 
This is currently handled by transparency and over-plotting.
- Add ability to filter by name or number of awards.
